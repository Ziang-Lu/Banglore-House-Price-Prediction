* **One-Hot Encoding**
  * For a feature `x` with distinct string values, we can use **one-hot encoding** to encode those values to quantitative features.
  * However, this may lead to too many features, also known as, "curse of dimensionality".
* **Dimensionality Reduction**
  * Using the above one-hot encoding, we may have too many features.
  * We can <u>combine some low-frequency string values of the orignal feature `x`, and combine them to a single value, like `others`</u>
  * In this way, we can significantly reduce the number of dimensions.
